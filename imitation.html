            <p>Most of this assignment was pretty easy but the last one was<br>
                SO DIFFICULT TO DO. Trying to get the text over the<br>
                background image without having it blur the text was so<br>
                hard to do because I struggled to figure out the absolute<br>
                and relative positioning to get two divs with one being the<br>
                background being displayed under the text div so I would be <br>
                able to only blur the background div</p>
